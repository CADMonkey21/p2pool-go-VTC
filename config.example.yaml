# --- Pool Settings ---
# Your personal Vertcoin address for receiving pool fee payouts.
poolAddress: "vtc1..."
# The fee (in percent) that the pool will take.
fee: 1.0
# How many shares are considered for payouts when a block is found (Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares).
# 4320 shares is equivalent to a 24-hour window on the Vertcoin network.

# The port that other p2pool nodes will connect to.

# --- Variable Difficulty Settings ---
# A stable configuration for smooth, automatic difficulty adjustments.
vardiff:
  # The ideal time in seconds between shares submitted by a miner.
  # The pool will adjust difficulty to try and meet this target.
  # 30 seconds is a good, stable starting point.
  targetTime: 1.0

  # How often (in seconds) the pool will check a miner's performance
  # and adjust their difficulty. This should be several times longer
  # than targetTime to get a good average.
  # This MUST be longer than the targetTime. 2-5x
  retargetTime: 3.0

  # The allowed variance from targetTime before difficulty is adjusted.
  # (e.g., 0.30 means the share time must be 30% faster or slower than
  # the target to trigger a difficulty change). This prevents tiny,
  # frequent adjustments. 0.30 is a standard value.
  variance: 0.30

  # The absolute minimum difficulty that will be assigned to a miner.
  # This prevents difficulty from dropping too low for very slow miners.
  # 0.01 is a reasonable floor for most hardware.
  minDiff: 0.01
