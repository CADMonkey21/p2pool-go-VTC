# p2pool-go-VTC Personal Configuration

# The network to run on. For Vertcoin mainnet, this must be "vertcoin".
network: "vertcoin"

# Set to true if running on a testnet (requires a testnet daemon).
testnet: false

# --- P2P Network Peers ---
# List of initial peers to connect to. The more the better.
peers:
  - "p2poolvtc.com"
#  - "127.0.0.1" This is if you run legacy node (python) on same machine.


# --- RPC Connection Settings ---
# These must match the settings in your vertcoin.conf file.
rpcHost: "127.0.0.1"
rpcPort: 5888
rpcUser: "your_rpc_user"
rpcPass: "your_rpc_password"


# --- Pool Settings ---
# Your personal Vertcoin address for receiving pool fee payouts.
poolAddress: "tvtc1q09pd5kr6pvcjdp809uc34esd42wag4ckkmxpz9"
# The fee (in percent) that the pool will take.
fee: 1.0
# How many shares are considered for payouts when a block is found (Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares).
# 8640 shares is equivalent to a 3-day window on the Vertcoin network.
pplns_window: 8640


# --- Port Settings ---
# The port your miners will connect to. Remember to open ports in firewall & router settings.
stratumPort: 9172

# The port that other p2pool nodes will connect to.
p2pPort: 9348


# --- General Settings ---
# The level of detail for logging.
# Options: "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
# This can be overridden at startup with the -loglevel flag.
loglevel: "info"

# (Optional) Timeout in seconds to wait for a P2P peer before starting
# the stratum server anyway. Set to 0 to wait forever (default).
# A good value is 300 (5 minutes) to allow miners to connect
# even if the P2P network is temporarily unavailable.
p2pSyncTimeout: 300

# --- Verthash Settings ---
# (Optional) The full path to your verthash.dat file.
# If you leave this blank, the node will check default locations,
# such as ~/.vertcoin/verthash.dat
verthash_dat_file: ""


# --- Variable Difficulty Settings ---
# A stable configuration for smooth, automatic difficulty adjustments.
vardiff:
  # The ideal time in seconds between shares submitted by a miner.
  # The pool will adjust difficulty to try and meet this target.
  targetTime: 3.0

  # How often (in seconds) the pool will check a miner's performance
  # and adjust their difficulty. This should be several times longer
  # than targetTime to get a good average.
  # This MUST be longer than the targetTime. 2-5x
  retargetTime: 15.0

  # The allowed variance from targetTime before difficulty is adjusted.
  # (e.g., 0.30 means the share time must be 30% faster or slower than
  # the target to trigger a difficulty change). This prevents tiny,
  # frequent adjustments. 0.30 is a standard value.
  variance: 0.30

  # The absolute minimum difficulty that will be assigned to a miner.
  # This prevents difficulty from dropping too low for very slow miners.
  # 0.01 is a reasonable floor for most hardware.
  minDiff: 0.01

# --- Testing Settings ---
# !! WARNING: FOR TESTING ONLY !!
# forceBlockFind: true
# (Optional) Set to true to treat EVERY accepted share as a
# block. This is used to test the block submission and
# daemon rejection logic. This will NOT find a real block.
# DO NOT run this on mainnet.
