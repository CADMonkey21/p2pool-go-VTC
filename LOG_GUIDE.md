# Understanding Your p2pool-go-vtc Logs

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the log messages generated by your `p2pool-go-vtc` node. Understanding these logs will help you monitor the health of your node and troubleshoot any potential issues.

## Log Levels & Color Scheme

The logs use a color-coded system to indicate the importance of each message.

* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font>: Green - Indicates a successful, positive event, like finding a block.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font>: White - General informational messages about normal operations.
* <font color="magenta">**`[NOTICE]`**</font>: Magenta - Important, but not problematic, events like sending a new job to a miner.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font>: Yellow - A potential issue or a non-critical error, like an orphaned share.
* <font color="red">**`[ERROR]`**</font>: Red - A critical error that requires attention.
* <font color="cyan">**`[DEBUG]`**</font>: Cyan - Detailed, verbose information for deep troubleshooting.

## Setting the Log Level

You can control the verbosity of the logs in two ways:

1.  **In `config.yaml`**: Set the `loglevel` property to one of the following values: `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, or `"debug"`.

    ```yaml
    # config.yaml
    loglevel: "info"
    ```

2.  **Via Command-Line Flag**: You can use the `-loglevel` flag when starting the node. **This will override the value in your `config.yaml` file.** This is useful for temporarily enabling more detailed logging without editing your configuration.

    ```bash
    # Example: Start the node with debug logging
    go run . -loglevel debug
    ```

## Log Message Guide

### Main Package (Startup and Shutdown)

* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `ðŸš€  p2pool-go (single-port build) starting up`
    * **Meaning**: The node is starting up.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Verthash: Initializing Verthasher...`
    * **Meaning**: The node is loading the `verthash.dat` file.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Verthash: Verthasher initialized successfully...`
    * **Meaning**: The `verthash.dat` file was found and loaded correctly.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `MAIN: Startup complete â€“ Stratum + Web UI on :9172. Press Ctrl+C to exit.`
    * **Meaning**: The node has successfully started and is ready to accept connections.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font> `Shutdown signal received. Saving share chain and exitingâ€¦`
    * **Meaning**: You have pressed Ctrl+C, and the node is saving its progress before closing.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Sharechain committed successfully.`
    * **Meaning**: The node has successfully saved the sharechain state to `shares.dat`.

### Stratum Server (Miner Connections)

* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Stratum: Listening for miners on [::]:9172`
    * **Meaning**: The Stratum server is running and listening for miners.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Stratum: New miner connection from 192.168.1.100:12345 (ID: 1)`
    * **Meaning**: A new miner has connected to your node.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font> `Stratum: Rejecting miner authorization from 192.168.1.100:12345 - P2Pool is not synced.`
    * **Meaning**: A miner tried to connect before your node was synced to the P2Pool network. The connection was rejected to prevent the miner from working on stale jobs. This is normal during startup.
* <font color="magenta">**`[NOTICE]`**</font> `New job 12 sent to vtc1q... (Height: 2453431, Block Value: 12.50 VTC, Share Diff: 0.29, 6 tx, 2.9 kB)`
    * **Meaning**: A new mining job with detailed information has been sent to a connected and authorized miner.
* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font> `SHARE ACCEPTED from vtc1q... (Height: 2453431, Diff: 4.43, Hash: 4730dc414197)`
    * **Meaning**: A share submitted by your miner was valid and accepted. This is the primary confirmation that your miner is working correctly.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font> `Stratum: Share rejected â€“ hash is greater than target for vtc1q...`
    * **Meaning**: A share submitted by your miner was rejected because it did not meet the required difficulty. This is normal and happens frequently.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network

* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `P2P: Listening for incoming peers on port :9348`
    * **Meaning**: The P2P server is ready to accept connections from other p2pool nodes.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Handshake successful with 146.190.155.56! Peer is on protocol version 3501`
    * **Meaning**: Your node has successfully connected and "shaken hands" with another p2pool node.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `P2P: Node is now synced with the network.`
    * **Meaning**: Your node has at least one active peer and considers itself synced. It will now allow miners to connect.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font> `P2P: Node has lost sync with the network (no peers).`
    * **Meaning**: Your node has lost all of its peer connections and will stop accepting miners until it reconnects.
* <font color="yellow">**`[WARN]`**</font> `Failed to connect to p2poolvtc.com:9348: ... connection refused`
    * **Meaning**: Your node tried to connect to a peer, but the peer refused the connection. This is normal if the other node is not running.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Received 51 new shares from 146.190.155.56 to process.`
    * **Meaning**: Your node is catching up to the network by downloading share history from a peer.

### Sharechain & Block Handling

* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `New block template received for height 2453751`
    * **Meaning**: Your node has received new work from the main Vertcoin daemon.
* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font> `!!!! BLOCK FOUND !!!! Share ... meets network target ...!`
    * **Meaning**: A share submitted to your node was difficult enough to be a valid Vertcoin block.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Submitting block ... to the network...`
    * **Meaning**: Your node is attempting to submit the new block to the Vertcoin network.
* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font> `SUCCESS! Block ... accepted by the network! Awaiting maturity.`
    * **Meaning**: The block was valid and has been accepted by the main network.
* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font> `âœ… Block ... is now MATURE with 101 confirmations!`
    * **Meaning**: The block has received enough confirmations to be considered permanent, and payouts will now be processed.
* <font color="white">**`[INFO]`**</font> `Triggering PPLNS payout for block ...`
    * **Meaning**: The node is starting the payout process for a mature block.
* <font color="green">**`[SUCCESS]`**</font> `Payout for block ... completed successfully. TXID: ...`
    * **Meaning**: The `sendmany` transaction to pay the miners and the pool operator has been successfully broadcast.
